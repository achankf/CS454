The possible values of $a$ are 0, 1, and 2;
$a > 2$ is impossible because at least one of $A_1$, $B_1$, or $C_1$, must be run before calling $A_2$, $B_2$, or $C_2$.
\begin{itemize}
\item
$a = 0$: $A_1,B_1,C_1,A_2,B_2,C_2$ (i.e.\ x,y,z are set to 1 before they are tested)
\item
$a = 1$: $A_1,B_1,A_2,B_2,C_1,C_2$ (i.e.\ x,y are set to 1, $B_2$ causes $a$ to increment, $A_2$ will not increment because $y$ is set by $B_1$ and $C_2$ will not increment because $x$ is set by $A_1$)
\item
$a = 2$: $A_1,A_2,B_1,B_2,C_1,C_2$ (i.e.\ $A_2$ and $B_2$ cause $a$ to increment, $C_2$ cannot increment $a$ because $x$ is set by $A_1$)
\end{itemize}
