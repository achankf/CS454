The executions are globally serializable.
First, it is clear that local history on both sites are serializable, since operations in transaction $i$ occur before operations in transaction $j$ for $x$ in site 1, and for $y$ in site 2;
hence, the first rule on the slide \#6-63 is satisfied.

Then, each site has a read-write conflict (say, $R_i(x)$ and $W_i(x)$, similarly for $y$ on site 2) and a write-write conflict (say, $W_i(x)$ and $W_j(x)$, similarly for $y$).
All conflicts on both site imply an ordering in the form $T_i \rightarrow T_j$, so the second rule on slide \#6-63 holds.
