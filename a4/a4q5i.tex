First, consider the coordinator.
The coordinator reboots from the logs.
Since the coordinator does not know whether all participants have replied, it should resend \emph{prepare} messages to all participants, and recovery is complete.

On the other hand, participants don't need to recovery anything.
They wait for messages that come from the coordinator.
There are 3 cases that participants wait for:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The reply has not reached the coordinator, or the reply has reached but the coordinator fails again.
In this case, participants receive a \emph{prepare} message, and they resend a YES/NO vote, and then they repeat the waiting process again until the coordinator receives all votes.
Since the question description says the coordinator must be part of every transaction, waiting indefinitely is ok.
\item
The coordinator has received all votes.
All participants receives a \emph{global commit/abort} message from the coordinator.
At this point, recovery is complete.
\item
The reply has not reached the coordinator, but some participants who voted NO do.
Since the transaction is all-or-nothing, the coordinator has enough information to call a \emph{global abort}.
Participants realize this because they wait for either \emph{prepare} or \emph{global commit/abort}.
At this point, recovery is complete.
\end{itemize}
