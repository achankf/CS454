Write quorum: $\{S_1, S_2\}$; read quorum: $\{S_1,S_3\}$

This is partition is valid because the total number of votes (4) is greater than the number of servers (3), each server is part of a quorum, and the number of servers in the write quorum (2) is a majority (i.e.\ greater than 3/2).
As for why this partition gives the best performance for client $C$, consider the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item
For reading $x$:
$S_1$ is in the write quorum, which means all write operations have to be done to both $S_1$ and $S_3$, so $S_1$ has the latest $x$.
Being in the read quorum, the quorum algorithm will always suggest $S_1$ as a candidate, since it always has the latest copy of $x$.
Thus, $S_1$, a server local to $C$, can always return its copy to $C$;
hence, read operations are optimal for client $C$.
\item
For writing $x$:
Notice that 2 is the minimum number of votes needed to form a majority for 3 servers, so write operations cannot be faster than this.
In particular, adding more servers in the write quorum will be translated into more write operations, since these servers need to be up-to-date.
Moreover, since $S_1$ is in the write quorum, $C$ can transfer changes quickly to $S_1$.
\end{itemize}
