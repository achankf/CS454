type "make" to create the executables

type "make clean" to clean up whatever that have been built

NOTE:
- if the client types more than 
		std::numeric_limits<unsigned int>::max() - 1
	characters (the -1 is reserved for the null character) before
	pressing enter (i.e. creating the request), then the request
	is ignored because the size represented in 4 bytes.
	As a matter of fact, I ran the following test.
		function maxx {
			# below the size limit, but all 4 bytes in the size header
			# are used
			perl -E 'say "a" x 1147483647'
			perl -E 'say "B" x 1147483647'
		}
		maxx | ./stringClient
	It's not likely that the user would like to wait for 20+ minutes
	before getting the reply from the server.
