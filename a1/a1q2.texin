Yes, there are advantages of using synchronous RPC, for example
\begin{enumerate}
\item
If the client needs to know whether a command has executed successfully, say an online payment transaction, then a synchronous RPC call would return the status/error message {\bf after} the remote command is complete.
Thus, delivering a request and getting the status can be done in one round-trip, unlike asynchronous RPC which only knows that the request is delivered and the status is not known.
\item
Also, synchronous RPC blocks the client, which may be a good thing if the computation is very intensive and the application has lots of clients, since blocking prevents clients from creating new requests.
\end{enumerate}
