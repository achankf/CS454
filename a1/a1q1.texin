Consider the following possible solutions:
\begin{itemize}
\item
{\bf Reducing distance to servers} Using what I call the ``Tim Hortons" approach -- setup as many servers (coffee shops) as possible, based on population density and accessibility, so that the servers are close to the clients; hence, network latency due to large geographic distance can be reduced.
\item
{\bf Reducing the size of requests and responses} Say there are data that are not changing frequently and the server needs to perform computations that return many values that take up lots of space, then sending small messages (such as references) may reduce bandwidth and latency.
Alternatively, instead of asking for a long list of items from the server, the server may break the results into smaller "pages" for which clients can request one at a time.
\end{itemize}
