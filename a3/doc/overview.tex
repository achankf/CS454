\section{Overview}
The design of my system is very simple.
The codes are pretty simple too, thanks to C++'s containers and RAII.
For the most parts, unless I made mistakes, the system conforms to the assignment specification.
I also attempted the bonus, so the system does more work in every request.
In particular, each node, which can be the binder, servers and clients, contains a local name directory that maps a machine identifier (ipv4 address and port number) to unique integer ids generated by the binder, and these name directories are synchronized in a way that exploits properties of the actions described by the specification.
I will go into the details later.
