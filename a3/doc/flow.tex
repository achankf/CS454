\section{System Flow}
The flow of the system goes as follows.

\subsection{Client}
Ignoring {\tt rpcCacheCall}, the system goes as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item
The client initialize {\tt Global} variables.
\item
The client calls {\tt rpcCall}.
\item
{\tt rpcCall} asks the binder for a server suggestion.
\item
If the binder finds a good suggestion, then reply the client with the server's id.
Otherwise, send a failure.
In either cases, the binder attaches partial logs of the name directory based on client's version in the request header.
\item
If the client doesn't get a valid suggestion, then end {\tt rpcCall}.
Otherwise, the client send an execute request to the server.
\item
The server gets the request, run it, and then reply to the client.
The server also send partial logs to the client, usually of size 0, because the client should have up-to-date name directory due to interactions with the binder.
\item
The client applies to logs, get the result, and then end {\tt rpcCall}.
\item
It is possible that later the client calls for a terminate request to the binder.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Server}
Generally, the flow goes as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item
The server initialize {\tt Global} variables and call {\tt rpcInit} separately.
\item
During {\tt rpcInit}, the server sends a {\tt I\_AM\_SERVER} request to the binder and wait for its id in a {\tt SERVER\_OK} reply.
\item
Then the server registers functions.
\item
Then the server run {\tt rpcExecute}.
At this point, the server sends a {\tt NEW\_SERVER\_EXECUTE} to the binder, and the binder will broadcast this request to all servers, forcing them to send a {\tt ASK\_NS\_UPDATE}, which updates all servers' name directory.
Notice that it is possible for the binder to catch some dead servers, which causes the binder to remove them from its name directory, effectively incrementing the version.
Thus, it is a possibility that {\bf not every server will be synchronized to the same, latest version}.
However, we will see in the last section that this is ok.
\item
Meanwhile, the server may get a terminate request from {\bf anyone}.
Thus, it will ask the binder for confirmation through a {\tt CONFIRM\_TERMINATE} request.
If the binder agrees the confirmation, then the server will call {\tt Tasks::terminate()}, which is a blocking call that {\bf may not necessarily halt. This happens when a thread runs a long-running process or an infinite loop}.
Once all tasks end, the server will exit gracefully.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Binder}
Unlikely clients/servers, requests can arrive to the binder in any order, but the binder handles them in a gigantic switch statement in a sequential manner.
In particular, the binder handles the following requests:
\begin{itemize}
\item
{\tt I\_AM\_SERVER}
\item
{\tt REGISTER}
\item
{\tt LOC\_REQUEST}
\item
{\tt NEW\_SERVER\_EXECUTE}
\item
{\tt CONFIRM\_TERMINATE}
\item
{\tt ASK\_NS\_UPDATE}
\end{itemize}
